# 🍃 Air Quality Classification Project

## 📄 Overview
This project focuses on determining the best-performing machine learning model for air quality classification based on accuracy metrics. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict air quality categories using pollutant features.\

## 🎯 Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to contribute to environmental monitoring and public health initiatives by accurately classifying air quality. This classification can help in identifying areas with poor air quality and implementing interventions to improve air quality standards.

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from [Satu Data Jakarta](https://satudata.jakarta.go.id/open-data/detail?kategori=dataset&page_url=data-indeks-standar-pencemar-udara-ispu-di-provinsi-dki-jakarta-2023&data_no=1).

## 📚 Library
- Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: Numerical computations and array operations.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization and plotting.
- Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization and statistical graphics.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- TensorFlow: Neural network implementation.
- Keras: High-level neural networks API.

## 🤖 Model Building and Evaluation
Several machine learning classifiers were trained and evaluated for air quality classification, including:
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes
* Neural Network

Model selection was based on accuracy metrics on the test dataset.
